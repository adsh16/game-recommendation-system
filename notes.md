Here are a few approaches you could take for your recommendation system:

Content-Based Filtering:

Utilize features like genres, tags, categories, platforms, and supported languages to recommend games similar to what a user has liked or played before.
You could create similarity scores using cosine similarity or other distance metrics based on these attributes.
Collaborative Filtering:

Use user reviews and ratings to find similarities between users and games.
Implement user-based or item-based collaborative filtering using algorithms like k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) or matrix factorization techniques (e.g., SVD).
Hybrid Approach:

Combine both content-based and collaborative filtering to enhance your model's accuracy and diversity.
